# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase I - Evolution of Todo CLI Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-01
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitutional Compliance

- [x] Technology stack aligns with constitution (Python for backend implementation)
- [x] No future-phase features included in current phase specification
- [x] Agent-centric development approach maintained (no manual coding requirements)
- [x] Spec-Driven Development principles followed (detailed requirements provided)

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
