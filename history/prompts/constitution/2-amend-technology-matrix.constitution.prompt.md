## Prompt

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.


/sp.constitution Amend the global constitution technology matrix to reflect Phase II requirements as follows:

Phase II:
- Backend: Python REST API
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- ORM/Data layer: SQLModel or equivalent
- Frontend: Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- Authentication: Better Auth (signup/signin)
- Architecture: Full-stack web application

Phase I remains:
- In-memory console application only

Phase III and later:
- Advanced cloud infrastructure, agents, AI, orchestration

Rules:
- Authentication is allowed starting Phase II
- Web frontend is allowed starting Phase II
- Neon PostgreSQL is allowed starting Phase II
- No AI or agent frameworks until later phases

This amendment must preserve phase isolation and act as the authoritative technology policy.

## Response snapshot

I'll help you amend the global constitution to reflect the Phase II requirements. Let me start by checking the current constitution file.

[Previous conversation content showing the steps taken to update the constitution]

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated constitution to reflect Phase I, II, and III technology requirements with clear phase boundaries
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Documentation update)
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md and related templates
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase II implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the technology matrix to enforce phase isolation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
